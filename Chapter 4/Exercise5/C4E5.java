public class C4E5
{
/*5 a. Create a class to hold data about a high school sports team. The Team class holds data fields for high 
school name (such as Roosevelt High), sport (such as Basketball), and team name (such as Dolphins). 
Include a constructor that takes parameters for each field, and include get methods that return the 
values of the fields. Also include a public final static String named MOTTO and initialize it to 
Sportsmanship!. Save the class as Team.java.
 
 b. Write an application named TestTeam whose main() method declares three Team objects. For each 
Team object, call a method named setTeamData() that declares a temporary Team object, prompts 
the user for values for the fields, and returns the temporary object to one of the Teams in the main() 
method. Display all the data, including the motto, for each Team object. Save the file as TestTeam.java.
 
 c. Create a class named Game. Include two Team fields that hold data about the teams participating in the 
game. Also include a field for game time (for example, 7 PM). Include a constructor that takes parameters 
for two Team objects and a time. Save the file as Game.java.
 
 d. Write an application named TestGame to instantiate a Game object, prompt the user for the Game details, 
and then pass the Game to a method that displays the details about the Game. (Note that in this program, 
depending on what the user enters, the two teams are not necessarily playing the same sport! You will be 
able to fix this logical flaw after you learn about decision making.) Save the file as TestGame.java.*/
