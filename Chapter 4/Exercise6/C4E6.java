/*Write a Java application that prompts the user for an int and a double and then uses Math class methods to 
	display each of the following:
 
 a. The square root of the int

 b. A random number between 0 and the int (Hint: The Math.random() method returns a value between 
	0 and 1. For example, if the int is 10, you want a number that is 10 times larger than the value returned.)

 c. The value of the floor, ceiling, and round of the double

 d. The larger and the smaller of the int and the double

 Save the application as MathTest.java. */
